setup:
- set minRawOilPrice and maxRawOilPrice
- set start price adjustment of market leader
- set capacities of drivers randomly

general notes:
- drivers drive in static speed in a random direction
- each tick represents an hour
- each distance unit represents 10 km
- every driver uses 1l gasoline per 10 km (each step)
- if a drivers leftGasoline <= 0.2*capacity then drive to the cheapest gas station in range

daily:
- rawOilPricePerLiter is set randomly in the interval of minRawOilPrice and maxRawOilPrice
- market leader gas station sets it pricePerLiter by rawOilPrice*priceAdjustment
- market follower gas stations set there pricePerLiter by marketLeaderGasStation.pricePerLiter*priceAdjustment

hourly:
- gas stations change there price according to demand, prices of close gas stations and the raw oil price

metrics:
	1 tick = 1 hour = 60 steps
	1 step = 1 min = 1 distance = 0.25 liter of gasoline
	note: we don't measure distance in km or miles, only in the abstract value "distance"/"steps"


How to choose the gas station for refuel?
	which gas stations can I reach?
	stations[]

	station1	10=0,5   1,20/l  result: 1,7
	station2	15=0,75  1,30/l  result: 2,05
	station3  5=0,25	 1,40/l  result: 1,65
	station4  4=0,2    1,45/l  result: 1,65



How to adjust the price each hour?

	raw oil price is minimum

	marge * #customer  = 

		rawoil 1 €
		s1   0,25€ * 6 = 1,5€
		s2   0,30€ * 4 = 1,2
		s3   0,50€ * 2 = 1,0
		s4   0,40€ * 9 = 3,6
		s5
